title: "ReactEurope 2015 in Paris"
---
ReactEurope just took place in Paris on July 2nd and 3rd, 2015.

It was a great occasion to meet the growing community and learn more about the React ecosystem. All 19 sessions plus lightning talk and panels were filled with great content.

There are a few things I found interesting in all the content:

- React is not the work of one person but a community
- There are lots of Flux implementations and that is a good thing, all experiments will coalesce in a few solutions
- Immutability has a lot of benefits, look into immutable.js
- Using inline styles for anything state-related is something to look at
- GraphQL makes exposing and using your data for a wide variety of apps easier. It does not mandate a language or storage engine. A  draft spec and reference implementation were released during the conference
- Relay, the missing piece of React that deals with data fetching is coming in August
- Use Babel, really, you get many wins from the transpilation
- Animations are getting better but lots more work required, it is not done yet (see react-animations fir current state of the art)

React gives a great developer experience, is fun to work with and makes maintenance easier because components are easy to reason about, you can come back to to your code after a while and still understand it.

React-native has the potential to be a real game-changer for many domains. People can work on web, iOS or Android apps depending what they prefer using the same skills. I like the “learn-once, write anywhere” mantra.

React and its ecosystem may not apply to you but be sure to check it out before you dismiss it.
